## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```sh
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update your environment variables as needed.

### 3. Database Migrations

This project uses [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for database migrations.

- **Create a migration:**
  ```sh
  migrate create -ext psql -dir internal/db/migrations -seq MIGRATION_NAME
  ```

- **Run migrations:**
  ```sh
  migrate -path internal/db/migrations -database "postgresql://postgres:YOURPASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOURDB?sslmode=disable" -verbose up
  ```

## 🏃 Running the Server

```sh
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port `8080` by default.

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/users/signup` — Register a new user
- `POST /api/v1/users/verify-email` — Verify user email
- `POST /api/v1/users/login` — User login

---

## 📚 Documentation

See [`docs/migrations.md`](docs/migrations.md) for migration instructions and more.

## 📝 Customization

- Add your own models in `internal/models/`.
- Extend services and controllers as needed.
- Add new middleware in `middleware/`.
- Utility functions can be placed in `internal/utils/`.
